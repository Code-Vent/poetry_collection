A choir of hills sings to me
The beauty of this city
A sight it is to behold
A city cast of gold
Loved like rose petals
Sought like gold medals

Revered you are amongst men
A treasure preserved, unbroken hymen
Souls hurry to find warmth in your embrace
And On your lush plains,
That’s where angels grace

I never thought green could be so pretty
Never thought dream could feel so real
If I lose my sight after seeing you
Please don't call me blind
If there is anything out there more beautiful
I've seen you, I don't mind
