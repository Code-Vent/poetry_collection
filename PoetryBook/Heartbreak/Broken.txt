I used to feel we were destined to meet
Like two lines that are perpendicular
But I no longer trust my senses
My heart in particular

We were two peas in a pod
But you murdered our host
So I hope you are a corpse
Now that Iâ€™m a ghost

We were as inseparable
As a snail and the shell
But you left me, mind broken
Like a bullet to the head

Could we ever get back together?
I guess only time would tell
Our hearts far asunder
Time would have to yell
