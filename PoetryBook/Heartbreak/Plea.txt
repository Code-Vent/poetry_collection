She looked at me, but not with her eyes;
With the eye of disdain;
Oh my world, the sun will not rise;
And my moon will refrain;
I have invoked the wrath;
Of the love deity;
For I sang a ballad;
To another Daisy;

Now her eyes are filled with tears;
And in any moment, they could drop;
But beneath the pain she bears;
Is a gentle soul that wants it all to work;
Oh my! I've made a woman cry;
And the feeling makes me ill;
Here I am, desperately longing for a sigh;
As I wait upon her heart to heal;

I can no longer carry her emblem;
For I am a broken seal;
A heart and pen not in tandem;
A poet with a broken quill;
It might be too late to save my own face;
Like a darned silhouette;
I may have sealed my own fate;
A darned one eyed poet;

But all hopes may not have been lost;
Surely our love is in chains;
The last hope could be a piece of the broken trust;
Or the happy moments awoken once again;
Let me sing the hatred in your heart to a permanent sleep;
And bring the comatose love back to life;
For my heart is yours to keep;
I'm your husband and you are my wife;

Honey don't ignore my plea for another decade;
The last got me no closer to your heart, like loose sprockets;
I have reached a half-life in this decay;
I am dust, hail and tiny droplets;
Afraid soon I'll be gone with the wind;
My dying wishes are itemized;
Unless you save me on the last ding;
For I am already atomized;

In the name of our love, I apologize;
Forgive me darling for I didn't realize;
Hurting you wasn't part of the plan;
A pain unbearable, not even for a man;
But you are my wish and it will come to pass;
Even if this is the end of time;
For the last grain of sand in the hourglass;
I shall trade all my dime;
