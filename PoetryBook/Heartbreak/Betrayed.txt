I lose my head
More than I find my sanity
With her, it feels more like hell
Than a sanctuary
The feelings I cover with a shell
The words I write in my diary
The stings and the swell
I must have been mobbed in an apiary

She pushed me to my doom
So my pieces could watch her pick me up
She puts knife in my wound
A stitch and nine couldn't stop the blood
I lay weak in my room
She sneaked-in to beat me up
She is a storm, the heavy monsoon
That swept my castle off the rock

What good is the monarch?
When the kingdom is in ruins
If the court is now a barnyard
Who shall hail the queen?
Unexpected is a lover's betrayal
And an unforgivable sin
Well, she can try to reach the lord in prayer
But I doubt that phone will ring
