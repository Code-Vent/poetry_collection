My friend Sam is looking extra dapper today- Seriously;
He looks more radiant than Jack- When he won the lottery;
A quick sniff gave a hint- He’s got a hidden agenda;
A swift scan revealed- a rose and a marked calendar;
But my friend is not one to give much away;
He keeps his cards close to the chest;
It’s like a scene from a romantic play;
But the plot is anyone’s guess;
Anyway, I figured it was time for one of his prostate exams;
I guess he’s more interested in the seller- less in her yams;
I don’t really blame him - the doctor is a bombshell;
Her name is Caroline- She makes heads spin like a carousel;
But I couldn’t tell him she was out of his league;
And all he would get was a catheter;
I didn’t want to hit the nail on the head;
Oh! I didn’t want to be the carpenter;
So I told him everything was going to be fine; 
With my best psychic impression;
It was just an innocent lie;
It doesn’t make me a bad person;

Sipping a glass of wine in the comfort of my favorite chair;
Thinking of Sam’s horrible day- grinning from ear to ear;
I found the thought soothing so I leaned back;
As I wait on his crushed soul for a feedback;
Surely, if there is any good yielded;
It would be hug or a word that’s kind;
I mean she should see that Sam is the ugliest;
Even if it is true that love is blind;
A little later- He showed up as expected;
But he was far from being down or dejected;
He walked up to me- Gave me a hug and called me friend;
Deep down I knew it wasn’t how I hoped it would end;
I was the one with the hidden agenda all along;
I had set him up to fail- I was wrong;
I thought I was better because his health was in poor state;
Oh! He wouldn’t have found love without his prostate;
Now I’m feeling envious of what he is blessed with;
Earlier, his disease didn’t make me cringe with envy;
In all honesty, I wasn’t fair to Sam;
As far as a bad person goes- Maybe I am;
