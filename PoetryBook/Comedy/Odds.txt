Odds were, I could never be a superhero
Two decades bitten only by a mosquito
But love spiced up my life as sodium
She is my secret, not plasmodium
Her beauty can breach my walls like Jericho
Her smile can bring me to my knees
I panicked when quizzed by fellow heroes
So I told them she was my niece

Hear me! Hear me!! Residents of Cape Town
Thy cause is noble do not fray
I have my own world to save now
I welcome you all to save the day
