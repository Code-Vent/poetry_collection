unlocked

For so long I desired a soul mate,
But my soul was an inmate
Imprisoned by my own inner layers
But angel you came along and granted me bail
Now I scale mountains, Himalayas

I'm like a beast possessed
By the spirit of a bear and four monks
I'll make your beauty my fortress
There, I shall hibernate for a year and four months

For four months I shall meditate about thy eyes
Four I shall dedicate to each breast
Four more to worship thy thighs
And create tremor at the poles, till each melts

Ninety percent chance of avalanche
Hundred percent chance of rain
If I must say in love parlance
She unlocked another layer of my brain
