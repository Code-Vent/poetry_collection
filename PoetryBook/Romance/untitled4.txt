We meet again in this life
Like I know we have, a thousand lifetimes over.
Your love is the ultimate high
Darling I can never be sober.
Completely opposite yet we make it work
Our stars align as the moon dims
Surely this can't be called luck
As it was always meant to be 


The thunderstorm opened a new chapter
For the ones who never had their forever after.
There's a hidden message in every raindrop.
Let them express the pain for which you tear up.
As long as the sky remains blue
The stars will always align at dusk
And as long as you remain you,
Your evergreen won't be called luck.
