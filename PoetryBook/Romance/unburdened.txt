Unburdened 

You're the reason I wake up every morning.
Else I'd have napped into oblivion.
And the world would find itself mourning,
For I'd be gone come dawn.

Now that my heart runs on your love.
You can feel it ooze with every beat.
If it's a problem, then I'll never solve,
For I consider it an unachievable feat.

I walk this sandy path fairly broken,
My bloody footprints must've guided you.
Because how can I believe I've been chosen,
If I've been fighting a winless battle?

But these are questions that cease to exist.
Now that you've paved way for a love that never walked a straight line.
You let me breathe again as the heartache exit.
For you're right here, and you're mine.
