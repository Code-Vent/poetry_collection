The sun is slowly raising its head;
With a gentle smile to nudge me out of bed;
Its rays delicately tap my skin;
As a royal maid would wake a queen;
Why should I be ungrateful? No reason;
I thank the Lord for keeping me together, No resin;
Life’s a battle, so thank the Lord when you lose your symmetry;
What could be worse? Well you could be in the cemetery;
By his grace you’re holding your fort, in this realm;
Your requests are endless but, he wills them;
He’s the lord of decree, you can only postulate;
Not on your own gain a degree, Fahrenheit or Centigrade;
