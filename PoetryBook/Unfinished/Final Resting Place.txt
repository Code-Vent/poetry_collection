My heart is under her spell, like a spindle
Encompassed, no room or window of escape
With a smile that heals all wrinkles
She tailored time and space to a cape 
If I could pass for a bullet in a pistol
That might be my outlet to escape
Or pass for a genie in a bottle
And ride some magical wave

As saturn copes with her storm's unending rage
Love stories come with twist and turn on every page
We adapted to the pace of the clock, and lived through times
At times, could not afford luck yet saved so much dime
