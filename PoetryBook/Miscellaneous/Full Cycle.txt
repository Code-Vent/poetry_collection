When the sun takes his place in the sky
The eloquent moon puts on a disguise
And sits by the wishing-well till twilight
When humans and angels would be his allies
Only then shall he mount the altar
To preach a shift in paradigm
Then, neither sleep nor slumber
Would be a heinous crime

When the moon takes his place in the sky
Mother-earth loses a sun
And a billion stars lend their lights
To his funeral procession
With a heavy heart they leave their brother's tomb
But take solace in the seed in their mother's womb
We shall only wait till a new dawn
To witness the birth of a new sun
