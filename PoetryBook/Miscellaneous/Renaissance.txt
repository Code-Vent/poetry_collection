Renaissance 

Nostalgia! The sight of a paper and pen.
My thoughts elude me, unlike back then.
Will I face my demons, and put them in words,
Or be consumed by them, and answer to God?
The tides point north.
Let the waves take you home, for all it's worth.

Hell and back, and you're back.
Nothing you haven't gone through before.
But shut your eyes long enough, you'll see nothing but dark.
Open them once, and you're looking at heaven's door.

And like a heavy load on a fragile mind,
That past should be left behind.
Let it thrive, the spirit you binned.
Be free, your troubles gone with the wind.

So pick up that squeezed paper
Finish the story which you saved for later
Write it well, write it true
This is a story of mine. A story due.
