I step out this day full of hope
Like a beast, I'm off the rope
Yesterday is now cold
But I'm glad that I could cope
So now I'm ready for the day’s labor
Like my water just broke
I pray I get kissed by fortune and favor
Like a polygamous bloke
Today I'm out to secure lawful things 
That will appeal to my hungry throat
Please God, Let me not become an offering
To appease the hungry road
Dear Lord I'm not destructive
But I must break yesterday’s records
Be with me every step of the way
And bless my every effort
The ocean is nothing but a fraction
Of your blessings lord, if I have to sum it
Your grace is beyond the heavens lord
And I’m at the summit
