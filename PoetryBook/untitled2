I’m like a moon that found its orbit;
And darling you are my center;
I’m like a bee that found its hobby;
Darling, you are my nectar;
You are the genius behind the words that I speak;
Oh darling, you are my prompter;
You give me room to grow, hands and feet;
Darling, my placenta;

You make big waves in my heart;
Like Poseidon’s cello;
And for you no price is high;
You are the perfect halo;
Ours shall be a perfect join;
Where love is the rivet;
I have sown the fairest coin;
In you I found my interest;
